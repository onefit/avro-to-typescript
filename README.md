avro-to-typescript 
========
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40chasdevs%2Favro-to-typescript.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40chasdevs%2Favro-to-typescript)

_Forked from [@degordian/avro-to-typescript](git@github.com:bornfight/avro-to-typescript.git)_

avro-to-typescript compiles avro schema files (.avsc) to TypeScript classes 
and interfaces. Making using avro schematics with node.js easy and comfortable.

This fork removes the schema registry and node-rdkafka dependencies for a lighter-weight install.


Features
--------

- Compiles most if not all avro types (**record**, **enum**, **primitive**, **map**, **array**)

Usage
-----

#### Global:
Most projects will use avro-to-typescript this way
```sh
npm install -g @onefit/avro-to-typescript

avro-to-typescript --compile [ schema-directory ] [ output-directory ]
```
This will generate namespaced folders and files for your schemas inside 
output directory so have that in mind.

You also need to install avro-to-typescript in your project.
```
npm install @onefit/avro-to-typescript --save
```

#### Project:
This way is if your projects needs to generate avro classes while running.
```
npm install @onefit/avro-to-typescript --save
```

    import { Compiler } from "chasdevs/avro-to-typescript";

    const compiler = new Compiler(outputDir);
    await compiler.compile(avro);

#### Logical Types:
If you want to take advantage of logical types, you can pass these as an argument to the cli
```sh
avro-to-typescript --compile [ schema-directory ] [ output-directory ] --logical-types [avro type] [typescript type]
```

You can even pass more than one if you alternate them:
```sh
avro-to-typescript --compile [ schema-directory ] [ output-directory ] --logical-types [avro type] [typescript type] [avro type] [typescript type]
```

You can also pass them to the compiler in your code directly:

    import { Compiler } from "chasdevs/avro-to-typescript";

    const compiler = new Compiler(outputDir, { date: 'string', 'timestamp-millis': 'string'} });
    await compiler.compile(avro);

If there are logical types in the avro schema but you don't provide a mapping for them, they will default to the underlying primitive type.
